write a java program that uses a linked list ordered by time using your own insert code to move values onto the list.

First insert 50,000 (time) values from the distribution below
30% of them are from a uniform double precision value from 0-10
60% of the time from  a uniform double precision value from 0-100
10% of the time from  a uniform double precision value from 0-1000

then print the frequency of values between 0 <= x <= 10, 10 < x <= 100,100 < x <= 1000
