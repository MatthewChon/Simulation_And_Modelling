Queens College CSCI381 - Simulation and Modelling Project

>### What does this course entail?
>>Analytic solutions to networks is an important field of research; digital simulation is used by many people in their jobs to model  systems. It is easy to make >>use of but requires some statistical understanding to interpret and get the appropriate results.
